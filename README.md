## Description
Hi! This is my another project as part of the frontend dev course. The site allows you to easily help you make a list of tasks that you have to do or cross off those that have already been done. To-do-list allows you to hide completed tasks, which you can then unhide. You can also mark all completed tasks with one button using the "Ukończ wszystkie".
## The technologies used in my project are: 
✨ HTML
✨ CSS
✨ JavaScript
✨ BEM
✨ Normalize
✨ GIT
✨ FLEX
